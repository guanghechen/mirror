## Demo

<!-- Demo source: https://github.com/nvim-mini/assets/blob/main/demo/demo-pairs.mp4 -->

## Features

- Functionality to work with two "paired" characters conditional on cursor's neighborhood (character to its left and character to its right).
- Usage should be through making appropriate mappings using `MiniPairs.map()` or in `MiniPairs.setup()` (for global mapping), `MiniPairs.map_buf()` (for buffer mapping).
- Pairs get automatically registered for special `<BS>` (all configured modes) and `<CR>` (only Insert mode) mappings. Pressing the key inside pair will delete whole pair and insert extra blank line inside pair respectively. Note: these mappings are autocreated if they do not override existing ones.

## Installation

This plugin can be installed as part of 'mini.nvim' library (**recommended**) or as a standalone Git repository.

There are two branches to install from:

- `main` (default, **recommended**) will have latest development version of plugin. All changes since last stable release should be perceived as being in beta testing phase (meaning they already passed alpha-testing and are moderately settled).
- `stable` will be updated only upon releases with code tested during public beta-testing phase in `main` branch.

Here are code snippets for some common installation methods (use only one):

**Important**: don't forget to call `require('mini.pairs').setup()` to enable its functionality.

**Note**: if you are on Windows, there might be problems with too long file paths (like `error: unable to create file <some file name>: Filename too long`). Try doing one of the following:

- Enable corresponding git global config value: `git config --system core.longpaths true`. Then try to reinstall.
- Install plugin in other place with shorter path.

## Default config

```lua
-- No need to copy this inside `setup()`. Will be used automatically.
{
  -- In which modes mappings from this `config` should be created
  modes = { insert = true, command = false, terminal = false },

  -- Global mappings. Each right hand side should be a pair information, a
  -- table with at least these fields (see more in |MiniPairs.map|):
  -- - <action> - one of 'open', 'close', 'closeopen'.
  -- - <pair> - two character string for pair to be used.
  -- By default pair is not inserted after `\`, quotes are not recognized by
  -- <CR>, `'` does not insert pair after a letter.
  -- Only parts of tables can be tweaked (others will use these defaults).
  mappings = {
    ['('] = { action = 'open', pair = '()', neigh_pattern = '[^\\].' },
    ['['] = { action = 'open', pair = '[]', neigh_pattern = '[^\\].' },
    ['{'] = { action = 'open', pair = '{}', neigh_pattern = '[^\\].' },

    [')'] = { action = 'close', pair = '()', neigh_pattern = '[^\\].' },
    [']'] = { action = 'close', pair = '[]', neigh_pattern = '[^\\].' },
    ['}'] = { action = 'close', pair = '{}', neigh_pattern = '[^\\].' },

    ['"'] = { action = 'closeopen', pair = '""', neigh_pattern = '[^\\].', register = { cr = false } },
    ["'"] = { action = 'closeopen', pair = "''", neigh_pattern = '[^%a\\].', register = { cr = false } },
    ['`'] = { action = 'closeopen', pair = '``', neigh_pattern = '[^\\].', register = { cr = false } },
  },
}
```
